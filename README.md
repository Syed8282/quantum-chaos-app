Introduction
Welcome to the Quantum Chaos Simulation! This project is a fascinating web-based application that simulates the chaotic movements and interactions of particles within a confined circular space. It allows you to visualize how simple rules can lead to complex and unpredictable system behavior, embodying principles of quantum chaos.
Observe particle collisions, track their trajectories, and watch as the system's entropy evolves, all within a sleek, futuristic interface.
Features
 * Interactive Simulation: Start, stop, and reset the particle simulation with intuitive controls.
 * Real-time Metrics: Monitor key simulation parameters in real-time:
   * Entropy Hash: A dynamically generated SHA256 hash reflecting the system's state, highlighting its chaotic nature.
   * Collision Count: Tracks the number of particle collisions, indicating system activity.
   * System Complexity: A qualitative measure (Low, Medium, High) based on collision frequency.
   * Particle States: Displays the current position and velocity of each particle.
 * Visual Trails: Particles leave subtle trails, making their chaotic paths easier to follow.
 * Backend Driven: A Node.js Express backend handles the core physics and entropy calculation, ensuring consistent simulation logic.
How It Works
The simulation consists of two main parts:
 * Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript): This part handles the visual rendering of the particles and the user interface. It communicates with the backend to receive updated particle states and send control commands (start, stop, reset).
 * Backend (Node.js, Express): This server-side component is responsible for the actual physics simulation. It:
   * Initializes particles with random velocities.
   * Updates particle positions in each simulation step.
   * Detects and handles collisions with the circular boundary, applying a "quantum noise" effect on bounce.
   * Generates new particles under certain conditions.
   * Calculates a SHA256 hash representing the system's current state (position, velocity, and trail of all particles), which serves as an "entropy hash."
The frontend requests simulation steps from the backend, drawing the particles based on the received data, and updating the various metrics displayed to the user.
Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.
Prerequisites
You need the following software installed:
 * Node.js: A JavaScript runtime. You can download it from nodejs.org. Version 18 or higher is recommended.
 * npm: Node Package Manager, which comes bundled with Node.js.
Installation
 * Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Syed8282/quantum-chaos-app.git
cd quantum-chaos-app

 * Install backend dependencies:
   npm install

Running the Application
This project runs with a separate frontend (the HTML file) and backend (the Node.js server).
 * Start the Backend Server:
   Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the quantum-chaos-app directory, and run:
   npm start

   You should see a message like: Quantum Chaos backend running at http://localhost:3000
 * Open the Frontend:
   Locate the index.html file in your quantum-chaos-app directory and open it with your preferred web browser. You can usually just double-click it.
   Alternatively, you can open it directly in your browser by navigating to the file path (e.g., file:///path/to/your/quantum-chaos-app/index.html).
That's it! Your Quantum Chaos Simulation should now be running in your browser.
Usage
Once the application is running in your browser:
 * Start Chaos: Click the "Start Chaos" button to begin the particle simulation.
 * Stop Instantly: Click "Stop Instantly" to pause the simulation.
 * Reset Simulation: Click "Reset Simulation" to stop the current simulation and start a fresh one with new initial conditions.
 * Observe: Watch the particles move, collide, and create trails. Pay attention to how the "Entropy Hash" and "Collision Count" change in real-time.
